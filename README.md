# Astable Multivibrator Circuit

This is a PCB design for a transistor-based astable multivibrator, a simple square wave oscillator. The circuit is configured to use two NPN transistors in a common emitter configuration, which causes two LEDs to flash alternately, demonstrating a 180-degree phase shift. The entire design was created using KiCad software.

## Components

| Component | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transistors** | 2N3904 (Q1, Q2) | Two NPN BJTs. |
| **Resistors** | 300 Ω (R1, R4) | Resistors for the LEDs. |
| | 47 kΩ (R2, R3) | Resistors to control transistor's base voltage and timing of the oscillation. |
| **Capacitors** | 10 µF (C1, C2) | Timing capacitors that charge and discharge alternatively to create the oscillation. |
| **Diodes** | LED (D1, D2) | LEDs that provide a visual indication of the output. |
| **Switch** | SPDT (SW1) | Single Pole Double Throw switch to control the circuit. |
| **Power** | Battery (BT1) | A power source for the circuit. |
| **Mounting** | H1, H2, H3, H4 | Four mounting holes for holding the PCB. |
